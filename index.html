    <p class="textContent"> Hi! My name is West and I've been designing since 2016. My design journey began as my high school yearbook editor and has expanded since to encompass
      a wide range of knowledge and expertise. My most recent foray has been in web design and coding. I am currently learning full stack engineering, studying HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript. I want to be capable and knowledgeable about all the things that I do, so learning the entire process was the obvious choice for me. I'm still learning, but
      I'm picking up more every day.
      <br>
      <br>
      Graphic design has been a passion of mine for many years now. I started with simple design through the yearbook program we used through Jostens, but since then I delved
      into the Adobe suite, learning and mastering Illustrator and Photoshop through classwork and personal study. Though my personal projects tend to have more of an artistic
      flair than my professional projects, I've learned many techniques that carry over across both.
      <br>
      <br>
      In recent years, I have worked with Ozarks Public Broadcasting and KSMU radio to generate social media content as an intern. Part of that internship included designing posters
      for a monthly event. I'm proud of the design and appearance of those posters and they were recieved with extreme positivity. I still desing mockup posters for my own personal
      projects as a hobby.
      <br>
      <br>
      In my early years after college, I also worked a lot with photography. My preferance is definitely portrait photography, however I have much more experience in 
      product photography. I've worked with Ozark Technical Community College's bookstore, as well as their caf&#233; on proudct photography for 2 years. I primarily photographed
      food for their social media (while also generating content about the products), but I also did a lot of work modeling OTC gear with the bookstore. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Overall, I have a wide array of experience with visual and graphic design that I would love to put to use for you. Let's get in touch!
